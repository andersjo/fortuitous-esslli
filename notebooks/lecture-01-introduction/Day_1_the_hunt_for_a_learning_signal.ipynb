Each $x$ is an example from some **input space** $\\mathcal{I}$, e.g., an image, a piece of text,.. Hence, $x$ is the system's input, and $y$ the desired output. For example, in natural language processing (NLP) $x$ could be a tweet and $y$ could be its sentiment, or $x$ could be a sentence and $y$ is syntactic parse tree; and so forth.\n",

    "In Natural Language Processing, we are mostly interested in learning **discrete** output spaces. Our output space will usually consist of a discrete set of **labels**  $\\mathcal{Y}$. For example, in sentiment analysis the output space could be represented as $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{positive, negative\\}$. The output might also be structured, for instance, $y$ can be parse tree of a sentence. We will see examples of structured input and output in lecture 2. For now, lets define the **input** $\\mathcal{X}$ as a set of discrete objects, e.g., the words in a document. \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we usually have access to a **finite** sample of the input-output space, generated by some underlying distribtion $\\mathcal{D}$. We do not have access to the distribution that generated the data, only the finite sample that it came from. In supervised learning, this finite sample constitutes our **labeled training examples**, i.e., $L = \\{(x_1,y_1),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n)\\}$. In unsupervised learning, we only have unlabeled examples, $U = \\{(x_1),\\ldots,(x_n)\\}$. However, lets focus on supervised learning for now.\n",

    "Thus, a system is usually **evaluated** in terms of how well it does on possibly **unseen data**. Specifically, given a new input, the system gets as input $x$ and makes a prediction $\\hat{y}$ (**predicted label**). The system incurs a **loss** (or cost) $l(y,\\hat{y})$ which is typically $0$ if the predicted label is correct, and $>0$ otherwise (if $y\\ne \\hat{y}$).  \n",

One crucial observation is that our examples are usually not atomic units, but are object that can be decomposed into **features**, thus are typically represented in some **feature space** $\\mathcal{Z}$. Even though the learner might not have seen the new example exactly, it might have seen similar examples (or parts of the current example), and thus still be able to make a prediction.\n",
